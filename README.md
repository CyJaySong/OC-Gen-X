# Opencore Gen-X
## All-In-One Opencore EFI and config.plist generation utility

OC Gen-X is a utility application to create a pre-defined config.plist and a EFI Folder to the users Desktop. Based on the system type selected by the user.

The config.plist generated is based off the architectures in the Dortania guide.
i.e: Haswell, Skylake, Coffeelake etc..

### Known Issues
Running OC Gen-X on a macOS virtual machine using VirtualBox is known to cause the app to crash. Still investigating the issue.
